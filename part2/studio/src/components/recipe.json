     "description": "Baked phyllo-wrapped feta with honey is sweet, salty, savory, creamy perfection. The other thing I love about this recipe is how versatile they areâ€”fantastic as an appetizer, or, if you serve these for breakfast with coffee or tea, you are setting yourself up for a very successful day. You could also put a big salad next to one of these and have a delicious lunch or dinner.",
